## Notes

I would like to note that for Deliverable 2, my clean DataFrame "wiki_movies_df" has dropped the original uncleaned columns for 'Box Office','Budget', 'Release date', and 'Running time' 
as they were replaced with the new clean data columns 'box_office','budget', 'release_date', and 'running_time' respectively.
This was done in an effort to remove superlative data, uncleaned data and improve readability.
This does differ from the Module 8 Challenge Instructions examples.
